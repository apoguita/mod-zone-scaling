 * Per-player combat normalization: the point at which this module stops
 * observing and starts changing fights.
 *
 * The model in one paragraph. A creature's real numbers stay canonical -- one
 * health pool, one set of stats, shared by everyone who fights it. What changes
 * is the damage crossing between that creature and each player, scaled so that
 * the fight *feels* like one against a creature of the player's own level. Two
 * players thirty levels apart can therefore fight the same creature at the same
 * time, each at their own difficulty, without the creature having to be two
 * different creatures.
